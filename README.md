Code for the preliminary analysis of neural organoid preserved co-expression data, bulk and single


Notebook descriptions

prelim_bulk_data_comparisons: pulling together reference fetal bulk data. Initial derivation of a bulk preserved co-expression score, simple linear model approach. Using a subset of fetal metaMarkers to predict expression of remaining fetal metamarkers. Overall, eventually angling for 2 scores for organoid data: a compositional score and a preserved co-expression score. Compositional score will be measure of cell-types present, likely simple bulk deconvolution based off of classically used markers. Preserved co-expression score is a broader reflection of how well those present cell-types in organoids recapitulate fetal cell-types.

bulk_compositional_scores: initial attempt at a compositional score.
